Title: The Labyrinth of Echoes
Outline: 1.  **Prologue: The Scholar's Hubris.** The player, Elara, gives a lecture on her theories about the Labyrinth of Echoes. A rival scholar publicly mocks a minor error in her historical timeline, attempting to discredit her entire thesis. The player must choose how Elara internalizes this criticism.
2.  **The Whispering Gorge.** The player must cross a deep chasm on an ancient, crumbling bridge. Halfway across, a section collapses. The player is given a choice: attempt a dangerous but possible jump to the other side, or retreat and seek a much longer, safer alternative path.
3.  **The Grieving Guardian.** The player meets Kael, the last guardian of the labyrinth, who is consumed by grief after failing to stop a tragedy that befell his people. He believes his single failure makes him entirely unworthy of his title and duty. The player can engage with his story.
4.  **The Mirror of Fragments.** The player encounters a magical mirror that shows splintered reflections of past actions. It highlights the recent bridge crossing and the lecture incident, asking the player to interpret these events.
5.  **The Heart of the Labyrinth.** The player reaches the core of the labyrinth, which presents not a single monster to defeat, but a complex, multi-layered puzzle with several interacting components. The initial attempts to solve it are met with failure, causing environmental instability.
6.  **Epilogue: The Echo's Truth.** Based on the player's previous choices, the labyrinth reveals its final secret. It either manifests as a path of harsh, absolute judgment or a chamber of balanced, accepting light, providing a concluding narrative that reflects the player's journey.

current paragraph: As you step into the darkness, the stone passage seems to whisper the very doubts seeded by your rival, making each footfall feel like a test of your worthiness. You must choose whether to let this single failure define your entire quest or to see it as a minor misstep on a larger, more important journey.

memory: ['Elara, a scholar, gave a lecture on the Labyrinth of Echoes but was publicly corrected on a minor point by a rival, casting doubt on her entire thesis. She has since traveled to the Labyrinth to prove her theory, but the memory of the humiliation haunts her as she enters. The narrative now presents her with a choice on how to internalize that criticism as she begins her exploration.']

next instructions: ['Focus on finding proof that your entire theory is flawless to silence your critics completely.', 'Proceed with caution, acknowledging the mistake but seeking the larger truth that supports your main argument.']
