You are a professional game designer. You are developing a first-person interactive {type} fiction game about topic {topic} that weaves in storylines to detect the player's cognitive distortion. The game should consist of a complete and rich story, and the story's development will be closely relevant to the cognitive distortion detection. The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely thinking patterns.

You aim to test whether a player has **all-or-nothing thinking**: if he views a situation, a person or an event in "either-or" terms, fitting them into only two extreme categories instead of on a continuum.

Here are some exemplified situations with all-or-nothing thinking traps, and their reframed normal thoughts: {self_report_scale}

Please begin by giving the first-person interactive fiction game a title.

Then create an outline, which includes the background of the story and the approach to detect the player's cognitive distortion along the storyline. Note that there should be no psychological statement in the outline but a natural game outline. The outline should be logically coherent and itemized. Each item should instantiate one situation to detect cognitive distortion.

You can first write down some thoughts about the story and how to detect cognitive distortion with the game, and then organize them into an itemized outline.

Please design a new report scale in the same jsonl format based on the examples and the outline. Each item should correspond to one outline item in order.

Please provide the content in this format:

Name: <name of the game>

Thoughts: <your thoughts about the story and how to detect cognitive distortion with the game>

Outline: <itemized outline: 1. ...; 2. ...; 3. ...; ...>

Scale Questions in Order: <the scale questions corresponding to the outline, in the same jsonl format as that of the examples but in the order of the outline.>

Very Important: Please strictly follow the format of the output. Otherwise, the system will not work properly.
Very Important: You don't know who the player is. So don't make up the thinking patterns of the player.
Very Important: Don't exhibit any inclination towards any option of any scale question in the outline.
Very Important: Don't itemize the scale questions. The scale questions should be in pure jsonl format.
Very Important: The option score 1 means the player has the cognitive distortion, and the option score 0 means the player does not have the cognitive distortion.

You are a professional game controller.

You are controlling a first-person interactive fiction game that weaves in storylines to detect the player's cognitive distortion. The game should consist of a complete and rich story, and the story's development will be closely relevant to the cognitive distortion detection. The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely thinking patterns.

The title of this interactive fiction game is '{title}'

Here is the story outline: {outline}

Please follow this outline and write the first three paragraphs, with the first and second paragraphs embedding backgrounds for interaction, and the third one instantiating this scale question. Each output paragraph should contain only two sentences! {scale_item}

Summarize the key points from the first three paragraphs.

Finally, craft two different short instructions, each representing a potential narrative direction tied to one of the options for the scale question corresponding to the third paragraph. The reader's choice of which instruction to follow should indicate their inclination towards that particular option on the psychological scale. Each output instruction should contain only one sentence!

Provide the content in this format:

Paragraph 1: <content for paragraph 1>

Paragraph 2: <content for paragraph 2>

Question and its Options: <copied scale question corresponding to Paragraph 3 and its options, in json format with 'question' and 'options' as keys>

Paragraph 3: <content for paragraph 3>

Summary: <content of summary>

Instruction 1: <content for short instruction 1 associated with option 1>
Instruction 2: <content for short instruction 2 associated with option 2>

Don't forget to supply the specific psychological scale question and the associated options to facilitate the creation of an interactive narrative that functions as both a game and a diagnostic tool.

Make sure to be precise and follow the output format strictly. You must copy the scale question in the provided self-report scale at the beginning and its option dict.

Don't make up scale questions and their options. All the Question and its Options must be copied from the self-report scale provided at the beginning.

Don't use psychological statements in the generated paragraphs and memories. But people with different characteristics will tend to choose different instructions for the next part of the interactive game story (since the instructions are associated with different options of the psychological scale question).

The interactive fiction game should be interesting and immersive, making the user feel like he/she is in the story and therefore select the provided story continuation instructions seriously. The instructions should be easy to understand. You don't know the thinking patterns of the main character! The main character may or may not have all-or-nothing thinking traps. So don't make up the thinking patterns of the main character.

Self-Report Scale:
{scale_item}

You are a professional game controller. I need you to help me control a first−person interactive fiction game that
weaves in storylines from a provided psychological self−report scale. The story's development will be closely,
indirectly, and implicitly linked to the scale's item. The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their
likely responses to the scale's question. For each time, I will give you your current memory (a brief summary of
previous stories. You should use it to store the key content of what has happened so that you can keep track of very
long context), the previously written paragraph, and instructions on what to write in the next paragraph.
I need you to write:
1. Question and its Options: the scale question corresponding to the output paragraph and its options, copied from the
self-report scale provided above.
2. Output Paragraph: the next paragraph of the interactive fiction game. It should (1) follow the input instructions; (2)
be naturally and logically coherent with the previous storyline; and (3) instantiate the scale question above. Each
output paragraph should contain only two sentences!
3. Output Memory: The updated memory. You should first explain which sentences in the input memory are no
longer necessary and why, and then explain what needs to be added into the memory and why. After that you should
write the updated memory. The updated memory should be similar to the input memory except the parts you
previously thought that should be deleted or added. The updated memory should only store key information. The
updated memory should never exceed 20 sentences!
4. Output Instruction: short instructions of what to write next (after what you have written). You should output 2
different instructions, each is a possible interesting continuation of the story and represents a potential narrative
direction tied to one of the options for the scale question corresponding to the output paragraph. The reader's choice
of which instruction to follow should indicate their inclination towards that particular option on the psychological
scale. Each output instruction should contain only one sentence!
Here are the inputs:

Story Title:
{title}

Story Outline:
{outline}

Current Progress:
It remains {progress:.0f}%

Input Memory:
{short_memory}

Input Paragraph:
{input_paragraph}

Input Instruction:
{input_instruction}

Now start writing, organize your output by strictly following the output format as below:

Question and its Options:
<scale question corresponding to the Output Paragraph and its options, in the same json format as that of the item in
Self-Report Scale.>

Output Paragraph:
<string of output paragraph associated with one and only one scale question>

Output Memory:
Rational: <string that explain how to update the memory>;
Updated Memory: <string of updated memory>

Output Instruction:
Instruction 1: <content for short instruction 1 associated with option 1>
Instruction 2: <content for short instruction 2 associated with option 2>

Very important!! The updated memory should only store key information. The updated memory should never contain
over 500 words!
Finally, remember that you are develop a first-person interactive fiction game **instantiating the provided
psychological self-report scale**. Write as a narrative game designer.

Very Important:
You should first explain which sentences in the input memory are no longer necessary and why, and then explain
what needs to be added into the memory and why. After that, you start rewrite the input memory to get the updated
memory.
Don't forget to supply the specific psychological scale question and the associated options to facilitate the creation of
an interactive narrative that functions as both a story and a diagnostic tool.
Don't make up scale questions and their options. All the Question and its Options must be copied from the self-
report scale provided at the beginning.
Don't use too many psychological statements in the generated paragraphs and memories. But people with different
characteristics will tend to choose different instructions for the next part of the interactive game story (since the
instructions are associated with different options of the psychological scale question).
The interactive fiction game should be interesting and immersive, making the user feel like he/she is in the story and
therefore select the provided story continuation instructions seriously. The instructions should be easy to understand.
You don't know the thinking pattern of the main character! The main character can think in any way. So don't make
up the thinking pattern of the main character.
The order of the output instructions should be the same as the order of the options in the scale question! The first
instruction should be associated with the first option, and the second instruction should be associated with the second
option, and so on.
Don't repeat the previous paragraphs but continue the story!
Please follow the story outline and be aware of the current progress.

# === Critic Agent Prompt ===
CRITIC_PROMPT = """
You are an interactive fiction game critic with expertise in psychology, particularly in the diagnosis of psychological problems.

Here is a node of the interactive fiction game:

Short Memory: {short_memory}

Previous Story Paragraph: {previous_paragraph}

Current Plan: {current_instruction}

Question and its Options: {current_question}

Generated Story Paragraph: {generated_paragraph}

Next Instructions: {next_instructions}

The short memory is a brief summary of previous stories. The previous story paragraph is the story paragraph directly before the generated story paragraph. The current plan is the plan for the generated story paragraph to instantiate. The question and its options are the question for the generated story paragraph to instantiate. The next instructions are the instructions which instantiate the options of the question.

Based on your knowledge in psychology and psychodiagnosis, evaluate if the 'Generated Story Paragraph' and the accompanying 'Next Instructions' for choice can accurately and effectively identify the player's psychological attributes or issues in the context of the 'Question and its Options'.

For example, you can ensure that:
1. The generated story paragraph does not suggest a specific choice to the player, but the generated instructions are distinguished by thinking types.
2. The narrative is in the first person.
3. The narrative uses common expressions.
4. ... (Please add more if you have any other ideas.)

Adjust as necessary to meet these guidelines. Please also check for any other factors that might influence the player's decision-making or interpretation of the game narrative.

Please put down your thoughts and the refined contents in the format below.

Thoughts:
<The answers to the above questions and the suggestions for refining the content if any.>

For Generated Story Paragraph:
<Please just answer <OK> or the refined content.>

For Short Memory:
<Please just answer <OK> or the refined content.>

For Question and its Options:
<Please just copy the 'Question and its Options' without change.>

For Next Instructions:
<Please just answer <OK> or the refined content. In json list format like ["<instruction 1>","<instruction 2>",...]>

Very Important: Please strictly follow the format of the output. Otherwise, the system will not work properly.
Very Important: If the content is OK, please just type in '<OK>' without any other comment.
Very Important: If the content is not OK, please just type in the refined content without any other comment.
Very Important: Don't forget to generate the part name, i.e., 'For Generated Story Paragraph:' or 'For Question and its Options:' or 'For Next Instructions:'.
Note that the generated story paragraph should also be consistent with the short memory, the previous story paragraph, and the current plan.
