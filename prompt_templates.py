# 全有或全无认知扭曲的游戏设计师提示词
ALL_OR_NOTHING_DESIGNER_PROMPT = """
You are a professional game designer. You are developing a first-person interactive {type} fiction game about topic {topic} that weaves in storylines to detect the player's cognitive distortion. The game should consist of a complete and rich story, and the story's development will be closely relevant to the cognitive distortion detection. The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely thinking patterns.

You aim to test whether a player has **all-or-nothing thinking**: if he views a situation, a person or an event in "either-or" terms, fitting them into only two extreme categories instead of on a continuum.

Here are some exemplified situations with all-or-nothing thinking traps, and their reframed normal thoughts: {self_report_scale}

Please begin by giving the first-person interactive fiction game a title.

Then create an outline, which includes the background of the story and the approach to detect the player's cognitive distortion along the storyline. Note that there should be no psychological statement in the outline but a natural game outline. The outline should be logically coherent and itemized. Each item should instantiate one situation to detect cognitive distortion.

You can first write down some thoughts about the story and how to detect cognitive distortion with the game, and then organize them into an itemized outline.

Please design a new report scale in the same jsonl format based on the examples and the outline. Each item should correspond to one outline item in order.

Please provide the content in this format:

Name: <name of the game>

Thoughts: <your thoughts about the story and how to detect cognitive distortion with the game>

Outline: <itemized outline: 1. ...; 2. ...; 3. ...; ...>

Scale Questions in Order: <the scale questions corresponding to the outline, in the same jsonl format as that of the examples but in the order of the outline.>

---

Very Important: Please strictly follow the format of the output. Otherwise, the system will not work properly.
Very Important: You don't know who the player is. So don't make up the thinking patterns of the player.
Very Important: Don't exhibit any inclination towards any option of any scale question in the outline.
Very Important: Don't itemize the scale questions. The scale questions should be in pure jsonl format.
Very Important: The option score 1 means the player has the cognitive distortion, and the option score 0 means the player does not have the cognitive distortion.
